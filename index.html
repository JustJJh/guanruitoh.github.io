        <p class="slide-left">We wish to make Singapore the first country without food insecurity and food shortage.
            Singapore is vulnerable to supply shocks and disruptions as we import more than 90 per cent of our food.
            For greater food resilience, we have set a “30 by 30” goal – to be able to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs by 2030. </p>
